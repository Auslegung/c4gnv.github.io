# Code for Gainesville

=====================

These are documents related to formation of a Code for America brigade for Gainesville, Fla.

“We are open to anyone and everyone who cares about making Wichita a better place using creative solutions.” – Open Wichita

"Brigades need leaders and members with all types of skillsets. Some ways non-technical folks participate include storytelling, community organizing, advising on projects as subject matter experts, planning events, writing copy, and more.” – Code for Durham

## Meetups

Our meetups currently last 3 hours. We lead off with a welcome deck and project standups. This should all complete in 15 minutes. Deck is here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fc9yEWy-78T2qFC_i1JMaXdzztYpVBEJwU7s7zOoDfI/edit#slide=id.g1418539bca_2_34
