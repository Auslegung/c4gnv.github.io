title: Writing a post
---
We use [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) for our blogging platform.

## Writing

1. Clone this repository and checkout the `develop` branch.
2. Generate your new post with `hexo new "<post name>"`
3. Run local server to see your post with `hexo server`
4. Posts are stored as markdown in the `source/_posts` folder.
5. If you have additional assets needed for your post, look for the folder created inside of `source/_posts` that has the same name as your blog post. You can reference these assets as relative URLs from your blog post.

### Deploying

1. You must have push permissions to the `master` branch of `https://github.com/c4gnv/c4gnv.github.io`
2. Run `hexo deploy`
